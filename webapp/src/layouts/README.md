Layout components are used to wrap pages and templates. Layouts should contain components like headers, footers or sidebars that will be used across the site.

=======================

Implementation NOTE: `layouts/Default.vue` has been replaced by `App.vue` as master layout so we can keep the header, footer on all pages and add page transitions for smoother app-like experience.
